# GACManager
This project is a fork of the [GACManager](http://gacmanager.codeplex.com/). 
It was originally developed by [dwmkerr](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/dwmkerr).

GAC Manager is an open source project that comes in two parts - a fully functional application to 
manage the Global Assembly Cache on your computer, and a C# API to allow you to manage the GAC yourself.

## Downloads
You could download any version on the [releases](https://github.com/vepanimas/GACManager/releases) page. 

## The GAC Manager Application
The GAC Manager Application is designed to offer fast access to the GAC. A lean application lets you search for assemblies quickly and get important information you need.

## The GAC Manager API
The C# API provides all of the functionality required by the GAC Manager Application and is offered to allow 
developers to write their own applications that work with the GAC.

A description of how to work with the API is available in the following [article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/430568/A-GAC-Manager-Utility-and-API).
